# Database Design and Implementation:

Create and populate relational database tables (Clients, Departments, Employees, Projects, and EmpProjectTasks) to simulate a real-world business scenario for efficient data storage and management.

# Query Development for Business Insights:
Write and execute complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights, such as employee performance metrics, project budgets, and departmental statistics.

# Analytical Reporting and Trends Visualization:
Analyze business data to identify patterns, such as task completion rates, average salaries, and project progress. Use SQL queries to provide detailed reports and visual insights.

# Optimized Data Retrieval and Decision Support:
Utilize SQL features like joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to retrieve, filter, and summarize data, supporting decision-making processes like resource allocation and project budgeting.

These objectives ensure the project remains interactive and focused on practical applications of SQL for data analysis and business intelligence.
