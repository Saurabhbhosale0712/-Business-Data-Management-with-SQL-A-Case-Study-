# -Business-Data-Management-with-SQL-A-Case-Study-
This project showcases a SQL-based database management system designed to handle critical data for an IT firm's operations, including Clients, Employees, Departments, Projects, and Employee Project Tasks.

"In my project, I built an SQL-based relational database to manage data for clients, employees, departments, and projects. I implemented constraints to ensure data integrity and used joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to efficiently retrieve and analyze data. The project focused on optimizing operations like project tracking and employee management, enhancing my skills in SQL and database management."

Key Features:
Table Creation: Defined and created tables for clients, employees, departments, projects, and employee project tasks with appropriate constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and CHECK constraints.
Data Insertion: Populated tables with real-world data to simulate actual business scenarios.
Complex Queries: Implemented SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, including:
Filtering data by conditions (e.g., displaying employees not working as 'Developers')
Sorting and grouping project information (e.g., projects with budgets > 100,000)
Extracting distinct employee roles and calculating bonuses as a percentage of salary
Technologies Used:
SQL for database design and query processing.
MS SQL Server as the database management system.
Key Queries in the Project:
Display client details for a specific business type.
Show employee details who are not developers.
List projects with budgets greater than 100,000.
Identify tasks that are in progress.
